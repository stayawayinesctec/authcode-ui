# STAWAWAY COVID authcode-ui

This is an interface for the health authority to generate authorization codes for the STAYAWAY COVID applications. It is a re-implementation of the Swiss [CovidCode-UI](https://github.com/admin-ch/CovidCode-UI) and uses the same [CovidCode-Service](https://github.com/admin-ch/CovidCode-Service) backend.

## Development

This project is a Single-Page-Application (SPA) built with [Nuxt.jS](https://nuxtjs.org/), a [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) framework.<br/>
For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

To configure the development environment:

### Template customization

This project resorts to [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for styling.

In order to customise the user interface of this project, update the CSS classes of the template section in `.vue` files.

### Internalization (i18n) customization

The `i18n` folder contains translation files for supported languages.

Currently, the following languages are supported.
- English - `en-US.js`

If you wish to add more languages, create a new file and add a new locale item to `i18n.locales`, in `nuxt.config.js` file.
